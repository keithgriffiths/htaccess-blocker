# htaccess-blocker

In this htaccess file is a list of bots you can block on web servers you use as they drain resources from your web server.  I use this on Wordpress sites and websites I want to protect.

### How to use this

Simply ad the contents of this file into your .htaccess file on your web server.

### Issues

If you find your website is not loading it might be becuase one of the bots in this file is causing restricitons on your web server. Simply remove the offending bot.
